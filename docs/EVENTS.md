## Event Types

The types of events below are roughly organized by type. Add these events to the `eventWhitelist`, `eventBlacklist`, and/or `specificEventBlacklist` to filter by these types events.

If you want to figure out what type of event a specific event on [LeekDuck.com/events](https://www.leekduck.com/events/) is, use your browser's dev tools to determine what class is setting the background color of that event. The class name is the same as the event type (except for `pokemon-go-fest` and `pokemon-spotlight-hour`, where the accented "Ã©" is replaced with "e").
